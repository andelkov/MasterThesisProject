# MasterThesisProject
Source code of my Master thesis project. 

NOTE: The main code is inside "PLC_program.ino", other files are generated by Visual Studio.

The general function of this program is to automate the transfer of pawns from one side of the 3x3 table to another. 

In order to accomplish that, I wrote 3 work modes:
  - Auto mode: with a 9-digit binary number specify how the table should be filled
  - Point-to-point: select a table side, pick a specific pawn, then select a new table and position where should it be placed
  - Jog mode: manually operate each movement of the manipulator


All of this in action can be seen on my project video on YouTube: https://bit.ly/MasterThesis_YT
